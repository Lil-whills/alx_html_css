## ðŸ“œ How It Works
1. Each FAQ item contains a question (button) and an answer (hidden by default).
2. When the user clicks a question:
   - The script checks if itâ€™s already active.
   - If yes, it collapses the answer.
   - If no, it expands it with a smooth animation and collapses others.
3. The animation is handled by CSS `max-height` and `transition`.
